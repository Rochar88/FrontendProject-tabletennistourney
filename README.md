# Description

This front-end web app was designed to help organize competitive ping pong players at a local level. Players create user profiles that will keep track of their game history, schedule, individual player statistics, and rankings (using a real elo formula).

## Planning and Approach
For our first front end development project, tasks were delegated and roles were identified as a mutual team decision. The plan consisted of getting the core framwork and fuctions working through angular and then constructing a UX minded Font End. 

## Team Roles
- Ranking page layout and interactivity - Shawn Pridmore
- Header, Footer, and schedule layout and interactivity -  Issac Escobar
- Create new Users and profile page layout, interactivity, and elo ranking - Roger Chavez

## Challenges
- First time using Github. We were extra careful doing pull/push requests throughout the project. 
- Figuring out how to properly route my pages.
- Properly making my pages reactive and accessing my players data and being able to update it.
